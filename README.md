All file names are unaltered from their raw versions, the only extra inclusions are the folders. Any item or entity with more than 5 sound effects associated with it, or any sounds that would not be immediately obvious, is given a sub-folder. No duplicates are present, and any file that could have fit two categories was sorted into the most suitable folder.
